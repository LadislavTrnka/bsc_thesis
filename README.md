# Spectral collocation methods in solid mechanics

This repository contains the implementation of the spectral collocation methods in Matlab for solving a classical problem in linearised two-dimensional elasticity (the deflection of a semi-infinite elastic medium subject to a surface load). For more details see [slides](presentation.pdf) or [Spectral collocation methods in solid mechanics](https://dspace.cuni.cz/handle/20.500.11956/173829?locale-attribute=en).
